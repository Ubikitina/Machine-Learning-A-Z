# Machine Learning Mastery with Python

## Description

This repository focuses on mastering Machine Learning using **Python**, following a structured and hands-on approach. The content is derived from the course [Machine Learning A-Z](https://www.udemy.com/course/machinelearning/) designed by industry experts, offering a detailed dive into essential Machine Learning concepts, algorithms, and techniques.

The objective of this project is to learn through the complexities of Machine Learning, starting from data preprocessing to advanced topics such as deep learning and model selection. By working through these materials, I will build a strong foundation in Python-based Machine Learning.

All code execution will be carried out in **Google Colab**, utilizing its powerful resources to ensure smooth and efficient computation within notebooks.
