# Regression Models

This section focuses on **Regression Models** used in machine learning to predict real-valued outcomes. Regression is a powerful technique applied in various domains, such as predicting salaries, housing prices, or any other continuous variable. The choice of regression model can vary depending on the complexity of the problem, the nature of the data, and the relationships between variables.

By the end of this section, you will be familiar with both **linear** and **non-linear** regression techniques, allowing you to apply them to real-world prediction problems effectively.

### Overview of Regression Models:

We will learn how to implement and interpret results for each of the following regression models:

- **Linear Regression (Simple & Multiple):** Models the relationship between independent and dependent variables assuming a linear relationship.
- **Non-linear Regression techniques**:
	- **Polynomial Regression:** Extends linear regression by considering higher-degree polynomial relationships between variables.
	- **Support Vector Regression (SVR):** A regression algorithm that attempts to fit the best boundary within a margin of error, making it robust to outliers.
	- **Decision Tree Regression:** Uses a tree structure to predict values by learning decision rules from the data.
	- **Random Forest Regression:** An ensemble method combining multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting.

### Use Cases:
- **Prediction vs. Forecasting:** If your independent variable is time, you're forecasting future values. Otherwise, youâ€™re predicting present but unknown values.
