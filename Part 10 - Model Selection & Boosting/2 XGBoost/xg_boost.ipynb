It belongs to the family of gradient boosting methods, which build models in a sequential manner by combining the strengths of multiple weak learners (typically decision trees) to create a highly accurate ensemble model.\n","\n","XGBoost is renowned for its ability to deliver strong predictive performance and handle complex data challenges efficiently.\n","\n","## Key Features of XGBoost\n","\n","1. **Gradient Boosting Framework:** XGBoost builds trees one at a time, where each new tree focuses on correcting the errors made by the previous trees, effectively reducing the overall prediction error.\n","\n","2. **Regularization:** It includes techniques like L1 and L2 regularization to prevent overfitting, ensuring the model generalizes well to unseen data.\n","\n","3. **Handling Missing Data:** XGBoost can automatically learn the best way to handle missing values in the dataset, improving its robustness.\n","\n","4. **Parallel Processing:** It optimizes computation by parallelizing tree construction, making it faster and more scalable for large datasets.\n","\n","5. **Flexibility:** XGBoost supports various objective functions, allowing it to be used for a wide range of applications beyond standard classification and regression, such as ranking and user-defined tasks.\n","\n","6. **Feature Importance:** It provides insights into which features are most influential in making predictions, aiding in feature selection and model interpretability.\n","\n","## Common Uses of XGBoost\n","\n","- **Predictive Modeling:** Used in scenarios where accurate predictions are crucial, such as financial forecasting, risk assessment, and sales prediction.\n","  \n","- **Competition Success:** XGBoost has been a popular choice in machine learning competitions (like those on Kaggle) due to its high performance and ability to handle complex datasets.\n","  \n","- **Real-World Applications:** Employed in various industries for tasks like fraud detection, recommendation systems, and healthcare diagnostics.\n","\n","## Why Use XGBoost?\n","\n","- **High Performance:** Often achieves superior accuracy compared to other algorithms, especially on structured/tabular data.\n","  \n","- **Efficiency:** Optimized for speed and resource usage, making it suitable for large-scale datasets.\n","  \n","- **Versatility:** Applicable to a wide range of problems and adaptable through its numerous hyperparameters.\n","\n","\n","## References\n","- [xgboost.ai](https://xgboost.ai/)\n","- [XGBoost Documentation](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"sO8VPU6n3vES"},"source":["## Importing the libraries"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"clDSsF7P33NU","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1728811846014,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":980,"user":{"displayName":"Maialen Igartua","userId":"00826372013938757765"}}},"source":["import numpy as np\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","import pandas as pd"],"execution_count":1,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"zGpwK5XD386E"},"source":["## Importing the dataset\n","\n","The focus is on applying XGBoost to a breast cancer dataset (data.csv) used previously for classification tasks, where various models like logistic regression, k-Nearest Neighbors, SVM, Naive Bayes, decision trees, and random forests achieved accuracies between 93.5% and 95.9%, with the decision tree being the top performer.
