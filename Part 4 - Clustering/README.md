# Clustering Models

In this section, we will explore **Clustering Models**, which are used to group data points into clusters based on their similarities. Unlike classification, where the categories are predefined, clustering is an unsupervised learning technique that aims to uncover hidden patterns or structures in the data.

Clustering is widely applied in scenarios where the goal is to segment data without prior labels. For example, it is used in customer segmentation (grouping customers based on purchasing behavior), image compression (grouping pixels), and anomaly detection (identifying outliers in datasets).

By the end of this section, you will be familiar with a variety of clustering techniques and how to apply them to real-world problems where the underlying categories or segments are unknown.

### Overview of Clustering Models:

We will cover the implementation and interpretation of the following clustering models:

- **K-Means Clustering**: A simple and efficient clustering algorithm that divides data into k clusters by minimizing intra-cluster variance.
- **Hierarchical Clustering**: A method that builds a hierarchy of clusters either through a bottom-up (agglomerative) or top-down (divisive) approach, without needing to predefine the number of clusters.

### Key Differences from Classification:
Clustering differs fundamentally from classification:
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Clustering does not require labeled data. Instead, it aims to discover the natural groupings in a dataset.
- **Exploratory Analysis**: While classification predicts known categories, clustering helps uncover hidden structures or segments within the data, which can then be further analyzed or classified.

### Use Cases:
- **Customer Segmentation**: Grouping customers based on their purchasing behavior, demographics, or preferences.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identifying outliers or unusual patterns in datasets (e.g., fraud detection, defect detection in manufacturing).
- **Market Basket Analysis**: Discovering patterns of product groupings in transactional data.
